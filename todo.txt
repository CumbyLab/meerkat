Todo:

Make a tiny interfacte which could:

pickup XPARM folder
load the frame filename
load the untrusted regions from XDS
load the hkl, find the upper limits
show frames
show untrusted region
allow to draw untrusted region by hand

- if input files could not be read with fabio, run 2cbf behind the scene to tonvert them to cbf
